## Signature Verification Using CNN: README

This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for signature verification. It classifies handwritten signatures as genuine or forged.

**Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (with TensorFlow 2.x or later)
- Keras
- matplotlib
- seaborn (optional, for visualization)

You can install these dependencies using a package manager like `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn
```

**Data Preparation**

The code assumes you have a dataset of signature images organized into two directories:

- `Train`: Contains subfolders for genuine and forged signatures used for training the model.
- `Test`: Contains subfolders for genuine and forged signatures used for evaluating the model.

**Code Breakdown**

The script follows these steps:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Imports necessary libraries for image processing, model building, and visualization (optional).

2. **Define Data Directories:**
   - Specifies the paths to the `Train` and `Test` directories containing your signature images.

3. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Creates two `ImageDataGenerator` objects for training and testing data.
   - Applies data augmentation techniques like rescaling, rotation, shifting, zooming, and horizontal flipping to the training data for increased robustness.
   - Rescales test data for normalization.

4. **Process Training and Testing Data:**
   - Uses the `ImageDataGenerator` objects to create generators that read, preprocess, and batch image data for training and testing.

5. **Visualize Images (Optional):**
   - Defines a function `display_image_with_label` to display a sample image and its label from a batch.

6. **Build CNN Model:**
   - Creates a sequential CNN model using Keras.
   - Stacks convolutional layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
   - Flattens the output of the last convolutional layer.
   - Adds fully-connected layers for classification.
   - Uses sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification (genuine vs. forged).
   - Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric (optional).

7. **Train the Model:**
   - Trains the model using the `fit_generator` method with the training data generator.
   - Specifies the number of epochs for training.

**Note:**

The provided code snippet focuses on model building and training. You might need to implement additional sections for:

- Loading a pre-trained model (if desired).
- Evaluating the model on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Saving the trained model for future use.

**Further Enhancements**

- Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., deeper networks, different filter sizes).
- Explore more advanced data augmentation techniques.
- Try transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or InceptionV3.
- Visualize the learned filters to understand what features the model focuses on.

This code provides a starting point for signature verification using CNNs. You can customize and extend it based on your specific dataset and requirements.
